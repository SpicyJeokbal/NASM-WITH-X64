## Introduction

The NASM x64 Examples repository is designed for individuals interested in learning assembly language programming on Linux. It provides practical examples that illustrate the syntax and functionality of NASM in a 64-bit environment.

---

## Getting Started

To build and run the examples in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Install NASM**: Ensure that NASM is installed on your system. You can install it using your package manager.

2. **Compile the Code**: Use the following command to compile the assembly code:
   ```bash
   nasm -f elf64 fileName.asm -o fileName.o
   ```

3. **Link the Object File**: After compiling, link the object file to create an executable:
   ```bash
   ld fileName.o -o fileName
   ```

4. **Run the Executable**: Execute the program using:
   ```bash
   ./fileName
   ```
